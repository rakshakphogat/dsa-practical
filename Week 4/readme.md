DSA Practical - Week 4

1. Convex Hull

Problem: Find boundary points by identifying points that are not inside any triangle  
Approach: Check each point against all possible triangles formed by other points using cross product  
Time Complexity: O(n⁴)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

2. Fractional Knapsack

Problem: Maximize profit by selecting items with different weights and profits within capacity  
Approach: Three greedy strategies - sort by weights, sort by profits, or sort by both  
Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

3. Matrix Multiplication (Divide and Conquer)

Problem: Multiply two square matrices using divide and conquer approach  
Approach: Recursively divide matrices into quadrants, multiply submatrices, and combine results  
Time Complexity: O(n³)  
Space Complexity: O(n²)
