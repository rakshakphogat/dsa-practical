Problem: Find the index of a target element in a sorted array  
Approach: Recursively divide the search space in half by comparing with middle element  
Time Complexity: O(log n)  
Space Complexity: O(log n)

2. Insertion Sort

Problem: Sort an array by building a sorted portion one element at a time  
Approach: Pick elements one by one and insert them into their correct position in the sorted portion
