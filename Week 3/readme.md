DSA Practical - Week 3

1. Merge Sort

Problem: Sort an array using divide and conquer approach  
Approach: Recursively divide array into halves, sort each half, and merge sorted halves  
Time Complexity: O(n log n)  
Space Complexity: O(n)

2. Quick Sort

Problem: Sort an array using divide and conquer with partitioning  
Approach: Select a pivot, partition array around pivot, and recursively sort partitions  
Time Complexity: O(n log n) average, O(n²) worst case  
Space Complexity: O(log n)
